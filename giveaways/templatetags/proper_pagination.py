                      include_first=None, include_last=None, include_separator=False):
    """ Returns a list containing a range of numbers to be used for pagination.

    Args:
        paginator: The paginator object to work on.
        current_page: The current page we're on
        neighbors: How many page numbers before and after
            the current page do we show? Default 5
        include_first: If we're to a point where the first
            couple of pages are no longer shown (see neighbors),
            how many of the first pages do we want to re-include.
            i.e.: 1, 2, 3, 56, 57, 58
        include_last: If we're at a point where the last couple of
            pages are no longer shown (see neighbors), how many
            of the last few pages do we want to re-include?
            i.e.: 56, 57, 58, 71, 72, 73
        include_separator: If you use include_first, or include_last.
            you can supply a separator between the first and last
            items added to an existing page list
            i.e.: 1, 2, 3, ..., 56, 57, 58, ..., 71, 72, 73

    Examples:

        For this example lets assume
            - Paginator has 72 pages
            - We are currently on page 14
            - We want 3 neighbor digits showing around the current item
            - We want the first 2 page numbers showing at all times
            - We want the last 2 page numbers showing at all times
            - Separate the first and last page numbers from the current numbers(with neighbors) by ...

        {% proper_paginate paginator page_obj.number 3 2 2 "..." as pagination_results %}

        Will result in:

            1, 2, ..., 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, ..., 71, 72
